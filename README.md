# Regex File Extension

This extension enables you to associate `.re` files with regex syntax, highlights matching patterns in other editor windows, and conveniently displays your regex flags at the bottom of the screen.

## Features

- **File Type Association**: Associate `.re` files with regex syntax for better syntax highlighting and language-specific features.
- **Highlight Matching Patterns**: Automatically highlight matching patterns from the `.re` file in other editor windows for improved visibility and context.
- **Regex Flags Display**: Display your active regex flags (e.g., `/gm`) at the bottom of the screen, so you can easily track and manage them without manually typing them each time.
